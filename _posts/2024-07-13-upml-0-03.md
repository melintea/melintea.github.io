title: Upml - a formal verification tool for UML state machines 
---

[Upml](https://github.com/melintea/upml) is a tool to transform a plantuml UML state machine specification into either a ProMeLa or a PlusCal specification suitable for [formal verifications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification).

Upml is marginally usable with simple UML state machines as of v0.03. Or maybe not. Any feedback is appreciated.
