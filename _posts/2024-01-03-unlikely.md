title: Likely to be very unlikely 
---

Two new C++20 attributes to guide the compiler with branching: [[likely]] and [[unlikely]]. For the moment, maybe not that useful. At least not with clang 14 & gcc 11.4 (same ballpark results) and not for the tests I ran[^1]:

- trying to guide the compiler over a simple if/else branch
- the test data is tilted two thids on one branch to one third on the other (dataset A)
- line (1) shows the results for the unadorned code, with dataset A. This is what is supposed to tbe improved.
- line (2) shows how much it can be improved (100%) if the data changes such that the CPU's branch predictor is at full guess (dataset B)
- but the attributes, applied right (4) or wrong (5) have no effect over (1). Nada.
- but can it be improved in code? Yes. Line (3) shows Pikus' branchless coding techniques applied for dataset A. It extracts two third of the branch predictor's max performance - as expected since data is tilted two thirds.

There is some hope though: cppreference[^2] shows a 14-15% improvement with the attributes on (and with a totally different use case):

```
gcc 13.1 C++23:
Time: 1.145634 sec (with attributes)
Time: 1.004937 sec (without attributes)
```
